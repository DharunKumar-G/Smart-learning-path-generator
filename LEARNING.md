## Hour 1: Project Setup & Architecture Planning
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- How to structure a **monorepo** with separate client and server directories
- **npm workspaces** - allows managing multiple packages from a single root
- Choosing the right database: **PostgreSQL vs MongoDB** - relational data fits better with SQL
- Why **Vite** is faster than Create React App (native ES modules, no bundling in dev)

### Key Concepts Explored
- Monorepo architecture patterns
- Separation of concerns in full-stack apps
- Tech stack evaluation and decision-making

## Hour 2: Backend API & Frontend Foundation
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- **Prisma ORM** - schema-first approach, auto-generates TypeScript types
- **JWT authentication flow** - stateless auth with tokens stored client-side
- **Zustand** - simpler alternative to Redux for React state management
- **Chakra UI theming** - extending base theme with custom colors and components

### Key Concepts Explored
