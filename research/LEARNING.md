# 📚 Learning Journey Log

This document tracks my learning progress while building the Smart Learning Path Generator.

## Hour 1: Project Setup & Architecture Planning
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- How to structure a **monorepo** with separate client and server directories
- **npm workspaces** - allows managing multiple packages from a single root
- Choosing the right database: **PostgreSQL vs MongoDB** - relational data fits better with SQL
- Why **Vite** is faster than Create React App (native ES modules, no bundling in dev)

### Key Concepts Explored
- Monorepo architecture patterns
- Separation of concerns in full-stack apps
- Tech stack evaluation and decision-making

---

## Hour 2: Backend API & Frontend Foundation
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- **Prisma ORM** - schema-first approach, auto-generates TypeScript types
- **JWT authentication flow** - stateless auth with tokens stored client-side
- **Zustand** - simpler alternative to Redux for React state management
- **Chakra UI theming** - extending base theme with custom colors and components

### Key Concepts Explored
- RESTful API design with Express.js
- Authentication patterns (JWT vs Sessions)
- State management in React applications
- Component library customization

## Hour 3: Docker & Containerization
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- **Docker multi-stage builds** - separate build and runtime stages for smaller images
- **docker-compose** - orchestrating multiple containers (db, api, frontend)
- **Environment variables** - keeping secrets out of code with .env files
- **Container networking** - how services communicate within Docker network

### Key Concepts Explored
- Containerization vs virtualization
- Production vs development Docker configurations
- Health checks for container orchestration
- Volume mounting for persistent data

---

## Hour 4: AI Prompt Engineering
**Date:** December 22, 2025

### What I Learned
- **System vs User prompts** - system sets role, user contains the request
- **Reducing hallucinations** - be specific, use structured JSON output
- **Temperature settings** - low for consistency, high for creativity
- **Few-shot examples** - showing examples improves output quality

### Key Concepts Explored
- Prompt design patterns
- JSON mode for guaranteed structured output
- Chain of thought reasoning
- Validation criteria in prompts
